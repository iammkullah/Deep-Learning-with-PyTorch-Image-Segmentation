# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch-Image-Segmentation

## Project Overview
Understand the Segmentation Dataset and you will write a custom dataset class for Image-mask dataset. Additionally, you will apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as its masks. For image-mask augmentation you will use albumentation library. You will plot the image-Mask pair. Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library. Create train function and evaluator function which will helpful to write training loop. Moreover, you will use training loop to train the model.

## Learning Outcomes:
* Use albumentations library for segmentation dataset
* Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem
* Understand the Segmentation Dataset
* Create training loop
